* Generic Exynos Bus frequency device

The Samsung Exynos SoC has many buses for data transfer between DRAM
and sub-blocks in SoC. Most Exynos SoCs share the common architecture
for buses. Generally, each bus of Exynos SoC includes a source clock
and a power line, which are able to change the clock frequency
of the bus in runtime. To monitor the usage of each bus in runtime,
the driver uses the PPMU (Platform Performance Monitoring Unit), which
is able to measure the current load of sub-blocks.

There are a little different composition among Exynos SoC because each Exynos
SoC has different sub-blocks. Therefore, such difference should be specified
in devicetree file instead of each device driver. In result, this driver
is able to support the bus frequency for all Exynos SoCs.

Required properties for bus device:
- compatible: Should be "samsung,exynos-bus".
- clock-names : the name of clock used by the bus, "bus".
- clocks : phandles for clock specified in "clock-names" property.
- operating-points-v2: the OPP table including frequency/voltage information
  to support DVFS (Dynamic Voltage/Frequency Scaling) feature.
- vdd-supply: the regulator to provide the buses with the voltage.
- devfreq-events: the devfreq-event device to monitor the current utilization
  of buses.

Optional properties for bus device:
- exynos,saturation-ratio: the percentage value which is used to calibrate
			the performance count against total cycle count.
- exynos,voltage-tolerance: the percentage value for bus voltage tolerance
			which is used to calculate the max voltage.

Example1:
	Show the AXI buses of Exynos3250 SoC. Exynos3250 divides the buses to
	power line (regulator). The MIF (Memory Interface) AXI bus is used to
	transfer data between DRAM and CPU and uses the VDD_MIF regulator.

	- power line(VDD_MIF) --> bus for DMC (Dynamic Memory Controller) block

	- MIF bus's frequency/voltage table
	-----------------------
	|Lv| Freq   | Voltage |
	-----------------------
	|L1| 50000  |800000   |
	|L2| 100000 |800000   |
	|L3| 134000 |800000   |
	|L4| 200000 |825000   |
	|L5| 400000 |875000   |
	-----------------------

Example2 :
	The bus of DMC (Dynamic Memory Controller) block in exynos3250.dtsi
	is listed below:

	bus_dmc: bus_dmc {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos-bus";
		clocks = <&cmu_dmc CLK_DIV_DMC>;
		clock-names = "bus";
		operating-points-v2 = <&bus_dmc_opp_table>;
		status = "disabled";
	};

	bus_dmc_opp_table: opp_table1 {
		compatible = "operating-points-v2";
		opp-shared;

		opp@50000000 {
			opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <50000000>;
			opp-microvolt = <800000>;
		};
		opp@100000000 {
			opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <100000000>;
			opp-microvolt = <800000>;
		};
		opp@134000000 {
			opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <134000000>;
			opp-microvolt = <800000>;
		};
		opp@200000000 {
			opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <200000000>;
			opp-microvolt = <825000>;
		};
		opp@400000000 {
			opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <400000000>;
			opp-microvolt = <875000>;
		};
	};

	Usage case to handle the frequency and voltage of bus on runtime
	in exynos3250-rinato.dts is listed below:

	&bus_dmc {
		devfreq-events = <&ppmu_dmc0_3>, <&ppmu_dmc1_3>;
		vdd-supply = <&buck1_reg>;	/* VDD_MIF */
		status = "okay";
	};
